            A Full-Stack web developer creates/codes the entire tech stack required to run a website. They need to know front end languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the website look nice, they have to know about API's like PHP that are able to transfer data into a database as well as a back-end languages like SQL or Python to store data. This career is all about coding, a web designer can give you a front-end design that you have to code.

The evidence suggests that that isn't true because of their value. For example, if you already of a team of 5 front-end specialists and have only 2 back-end developers, having a full-stack developer that is able to join the team of back-end developers in order to help the company.</h1>
