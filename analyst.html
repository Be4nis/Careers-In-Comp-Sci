            <h1 style="font-size: 3vw;text-align: center; padding: 0%; margin: 0%;">What does a data analyst do? How does it involve computer science?</h1>
            <br>
            <p id="pid">A data analyst collects, cleans and interprets data to do many things. For example, a data analyst working for Shopify can collect data to answer important questions such as: which users spend the most time on shopfiy and why? If the reason why these users spend a lot of time on shopfiy is to browse for backpacks, the data analyst can tell the programmers to let them know that they should put up more ads for them. 
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, data analysts gather data, clean and model the data, interpret and find a conclusion from the data and finally present the findings to interested parties.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although not all data analysts have to use code, it is the most common way to gather, clean and model data. For example if you are working for Amazon and want to find out which region has the most Logitech mouse purchases you wouldn't want to manually go through every region as that would take forever. Instead, data analysts would create a program that collects all Logitech mouse purchases and inserts them into a pie graph where you can easily see the findings.

            <h1>What is the demand for data analysts today? What is the average salary of a person pursuing this career? Does becoming a data analyst require any special training?</h1></h1>
            <p id="pid">According to my sources data analysts are extremely in demand around the world and the demand will only go up in the future. According to indeed.com, the salary of a junior data analyst in south Ontario is between $50, 000 - $80, 000 a year, the average salary of a data analyst in Canada is $60, 783 and internationally the salary of a junior data analyst is between $60, 000 - $100, 000. Location isn't the most important factor for the salary of a data analysist, but rather it is experience. A data analysis with more than 8 years of experience makes an average of $140, 000 a year.
                <br><br>
                With that high of a starting salary you must think that becoming a data analyst needs a lot of special training right? Nope! Not all jobs involving data analysis requires special training. Much like other computer/tech jobs, as long as you have a good portfolio you will be able to land yourself a data analyst postion. With that being said you must have data analysis specific projects that show your ability to scrape, clean and normalize raw data, create clear and accurate graphs/charts/etc. and your projects should show your ability to draw actionable insights from data. However, if you have an impressive portfolio along with a degree in computer science it will be much easier to find jobs.</p>
